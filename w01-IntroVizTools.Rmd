## R & RStudio
<BR>
### 1. What is R?
<BR>
<center><a href="https://www.r-project.org/"><img src = "https://www.r-project.org/Rlogo.png" width = 100 height = 100></a></center>
<BR>
R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. It is a GNU project which is similar to the S language and environment which was developed at Bell Laboratories (formerly AT&T, now Lucent Technologies) by John Chambers and colleagues. R can be considered as a different implementation of S. There are some important differences, but much code written for S runs unaltered under R. 

R is an integrated suite of software facilities for data manipulation, calculation and graphical display. It includes

* an effective data handling and storage facility,
* a suite of operators for calculations on arrays, in particular matrices,
* a large, coherent, integrated collection of intermediate tools for data analysis,
* graphical facilities for data analysis and display either on-screen or on hardcopy, and
* a well-developed, simple and effective programming language which includes conditionals, loops, user-defined recursive functions and input and output facilities.

### 2. RStudio
<BR>

<BR>

RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. It includes a console, syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution, as well as tools for plotting, history, debugging and workspace management.

There are two versions of RStudio: RStudio Desktop and RStudio Server. Both versions have free open source and commercial editions. We use the free open source edition of RStudio Desktop that has the following features:

* Access RStudio locally
* Syntax highlighting, code completion, and smart indentation
* Execute R code directly from the source editor
* Quickly jump to function definitions
* View content changes in real-time with the Visual Markdown Editor
* Easily manage multiple working directories using projects
* Integrated R help and documentation
* Interactive debugger to diagnose and fix errors
* Extensive package development tools

### 3. The Relationship betweem R and RStudio

R and RStudio are two distinctly different applications that serve different purposes. R is a programming language used for statistical computing while RStudio uses the R language to develop statistical programs.

R and RStudio are not separate versions of the same program, and cannot be substituted for one another. R may be used without RStudio, but RStudio may not be used without R.



## Tableau Public

### 1. About Tableau

Tableau is a powerful and fastest growing data visualization tool used in the Business Intelligence Industry. The great thing about Tableau software is that it doesn’t require any technical or any kind of programming skills to operate. Tableau suite has different products that causes confusions to new users.

<br>
<center><img src="https://github.com/pengdsci/sta553/blob/main/image/TableWhatis1.png?raw=true"  height="350" width="300"></center>
<br>

* **Tableau Desktop** has a rich feature set and allows you to code and customize reports. <font color = "red"><b>It is not free (actually pretty expensive)! </font></b>

* **Tableau Public** creates workbooks that cannot be saved locally, in turn, it should be saved to the Tableau’s `public server` in the cloud which can be viewed and accessed by anyone. You need to download it and install it on your computer to design workbooks offline and then save them to Tableau’s `public server`. <font color = "red"><b>It is totally free!</font></b>

* **Tableau Server** is specifically used to share the workbooks, visualizations that are created in the Tableau Desktop application across the organization. <font color = "red"><b>It is NOT free! </font></b>. <font color = "blue"><b>However, the public server is free.</font></b>

* **Tableau Online** has all the similar functionalities of the Tableau Public, but the data is stored on servers hosted in the cloud which are maintained by the Tableau group. That means you design workbooks on the Tableau's public server. <font color = "blue"><b>It is also free!</b></font>

* <font color = "red"><b>**Tableau Reader** is a free tool </b></font> which allows you to view the workbooks and visualizations created using Tableau Desktop or Tableau Public.

## SAS OnDemand

### 1. What is SAS OnDemand (SAS Studio)

SAS OnDemand provides **free** data management and data analysis tools. The advantage of SAS OnDemand is that it does not require any installation and it runs on the cloud via the internet and process data by connecting to the SAS server in the cloud. In other words, your computer is only used as a monitor since it does not use any resources (memory and CPU) of your computer.

<br>
<center><img src="https://github.com/pengdsci/sta553/blob/main/image/SASEntryPage.png?raw=true"  height="280" width="400"></center>
<br>

Click `Access` to enter into the SAS OnDemand login page.

### 2. Sign-in / Sign-up

If you have already created your SAS Profile, use the email or user ID and the password to log into the SAS OnDemand page. 

<br>
<center><img src="https://github.com/pengdsci/sta553/blob/main/image/SASLogin.png?raw=true"  height="280" width="400"></center>
<br>


### 3. Create An SAS Profile

If you don't have an SAS profile, click the link`Don't have a SAS profile?`, you will have the following pop-up dialogue box. Click `Create profile`, then you will see a pop-up sign-up page. You then following the direction to create your SAS profile.

<br>
<center><img src="https://github.com/pengdsci/sta553/blob/main/image/SAS1stVisit.png?raw=true"  height="80" width="300"></center>
<br>


### 4. Log Into SAS Academic OnDemand

Provide the your profile information to log into the OnDemand page, you will see the link to SAS Studio user interface and your account information as well. 

<br>
<center><img src="https://github.com/pengdsci/sta553/blob/main/image/SASProfileFrontPage.png?raw=true"  height="280" width="400"></center>
<br>

Once you created an SAS profile, you will have 5 GB free storage. 

### 5. SAS Studio User Interfacce

In the `Applications` tab, click `SAS Studio`, you see the SAS Studio user interface in a separate page (it may take a little bit time to initialize your account if you use it for the first time).

<br>
<center><img src="https://github.com/pengdsci/sta553/blob/main/image/SASStudioUI.png?raw=true"  height="280" width="500"></center>
<br>

The above screenshot was taken from my SAS course webpage. For those who learned SAS using the classical SAS, you will see SAS Studio is much more convenient and easier to use. 

### **A Cautionary Note On Data Security**

<font color = "red">SAS Studio (Academic OnDemand) is installed on SAS servers hosted in the Microsoft Azure Cloud. Although SAS claims that your assigned storage is private and secured, it is suggested avoiding uploading `sensitive data` to you private storage on SAS server since SAS does not release the level of security for the storage.</font>


## R Viz Libraries

The following libraries will be used throughout this class.

### 1. Tidyverse 

### 2. ggplot2

Ggplot2 is a system for creating charts based on the Grammar of Graphics. It proved to be one of the most powerful R libraries for visualization.


### 3. plotly

`plotly` is an online platform for data visualization in R (also available in Python). This package creates interactive web-based plots using `plotly.js` library. Plotly gives users an opportunity to interact with graphs, change their scale and point out the necessary record. The library also supports graph hovering. Moreover, one can easily add Plotly in knitr/R Markdown or Shiny apps.


### 4. leaflet

Leaflet is a well-known package based on JavaScript libraries for interactive maps. It is widely used for mapping and working with the customization and design of interactive maps. Besides, Leaflet provides an opportunity to make these maps mobile-friendly.

### 5. mapview

### 6. tmap

### 7. Other infrequently used packages

`ggmap`, `map`, `dygraph`,
